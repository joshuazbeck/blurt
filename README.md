Problem statement: _Many social media platforms encourage comparison and body-imaging issues.  This is largely due to the ability to post polished photos representing the finest moments of one’s life.  To address this cultural issue, the author is attempting to build a social media platform not based on physical elements but instead based on raw audio thoughts.  This will provide an alternative for those who enjoy connecting with friends while also as a platform not promoting body comparison and insecurity._

Solution: **A cross-platform social media app for users to share one short 15-second audio thoughts a day and react to friends' previous day's audio thoughts.  This app will include features from logging in, to finding friends, adding and deleting audio posts, and panning audio.**

This project will be built using Dart on Flutter with a Node.JS backend hosted on Google Cloud Run.  Files will be stored remotely using Google Cloud Storage.
